# qplib

A query language for pandas data exploration/analysis/modification.

It is implemented as an [accessor extension](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/extending.html), meaning it can be called from a dataframe without any further preparation.  

An interactive wrapper can be called with df.qi() to help with the query creation and for exploring the various operators.

# other utilities

## logging with qp.log()

A small logger to be used in notebooks. Makes it easier to keep track of outputs in large notebooks by providing color coded output and. Does not log to file, but instead to a dataframe in globals() which can then be viewed at the end of the notebook.

## "bashlike" wrappers

While python has functions to achieve similar results as common bash commands, they are often more verbose, less intuitive if you are already used to the bash names and spread out over different modules and different namespaces in those modules (os, os.path, shutil, sys, ...).  
These wrappers use the same names as the bash commands and offer some additional functionality.


available wrappers:  
- qp.ls()  
- qp.lsr()  
- qp.pwd()  
- qp.cd()  
- qp.cp()  
- qp.mkdir()  
- qp.isfile()  
- qp.isdir()  
- qp.ispath()  
<br>

## type conversion 
Mostly wrappers for pandas functions but with some additional functionality. 

available functions:  
- qp.na()  
- qp.nk()  
- qp.num()  
- qp.yn()  
- qp.date()  
- qp.datetime()
